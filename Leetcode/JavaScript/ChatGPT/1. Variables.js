/*You have 3 glasses represented by variables:
* Challenge: Swap the contents so that:
- glass 1 ends up empty
- glass 2 ends up with water
- glass 3 ends up with juice
But you can only use one extra temporary variable to make the swap*/
let glass1 = "water";
let glass2 = "juice";
let glass3 = "empty";
let temp = glass1;
